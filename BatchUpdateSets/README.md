# Batch Update Sets - Extension for Bulk Download and Rename of Update Sets

This is an extension of the utility [Bulk Download-Rename of Update Sets by Jason Siegrist](https://developer.servicenow.com/connect.do#!/share/contents/5979617_bulk_download_naming_of_update_sets?t=PRODUCT_DETAILS) to add batch update set functionality.

It is required you install Jason's utility first (version 1.2 is tested/recommended), then install this extension update set.

## Features

* Export batch update sets from a list view. Just select the parent update sets and run the "Export Update Set Batch to XML (bulk)" action.
* The XMLs are named after the parent update set for both bulk and OOB single batch exports.
